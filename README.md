# Market-Analysis---Arbitrage

Before searching for triangular arbitrage opportunities, it was important to first study the overall market behavior of the assets involved in the trading triangle. In this case, a time-series analysis of Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) was carried out on August 3, 2025, using 1-hour interval data from Binance’s historical records. This step helped to understand key factors such as volatility, price trends, and trading volumes, all of which directly affect how often arbitrage opportunities appear and how profitable they can be.
By looking at the price movements of SOL/USDT and ETH/USDT throughout the day, I was  able to spot periods of high volatility or unusual trading activity that might create price gaps across the related pairs. The analysis included candlestick charts, trading volume spikes, and hourly returns, which gave a more detailed view of market conditions. Statistical measures such as the correlation between SOL and ETH prices were also calculated. Correlation is especially important in triangular arbitrage: when assets move very closely together, arbitrage windows are often smaller; when they move more independently, opportunities are more likely to appear.
To make this clearer, a range of visualizations—such as price overview charts, volume distributions, and return patterns—were also produced and studied.
